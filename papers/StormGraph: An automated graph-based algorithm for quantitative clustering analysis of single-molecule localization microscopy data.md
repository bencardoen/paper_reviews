abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can play an important role in integrated structural biology approaches for example at the interface of cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, NMR and fluorescence imaging to identify, localize and determine the 3D structure of cellular structures. While many tools exist for the 3D analysis and visualisation of crystal or cryo-EM structures little exists for 3D SMLM data which can provide fascinating insights but are particularly challenging to analyze in three dimensions especially in a dense cellular context. We developed 3DClusterViSu, a method based on 3D Voronoi tessellations that allows local density estimation, segmentation {\&} quantification of 3D SMLM data and visualization of protein clusters within a 3D tool. We show its robust performance on microtubules and histone proteins H2B and CENP-A with distinct spatial distributions. 3DClusterViSu will favor multi-scale and multi-resolution synergies to allow integrating molecular and cellular levels in the analysis of macromolecular complexes.},

#### Research Question
3D localization clustering using uncertainty, autotuned

#### Contribution
Autotuned, heterogenuous, uncertainty based, fire and forget, fast, hierarchical, 2 color overlap

#### Method
- uncertainty defines weighted graph
- sij = 1- rij/ro if rij<ro, else 0
- remove nodes if deg(i) < data driven threshold
- alpha = 0.05 (default)
- infomap as hierarchical clustering
- knn k (10,15,20) defines r0
- works on ROI (partitions data in ROIs)
- area/volume overlap (dangerous in doublelabelling)
- Uncertainty : To do this, we 392 delete every edge that has nonzero sij in less than 75% of the Monte Carlo simulations that were used to 393 calculate the edge weights. This guarantees that any pair of retained edges have at least an estimated 50% 394 probability of co-occurring in the r0-neighborhood graph for any realization of the data
- hierarchical clustering heuristic (Symmetric KNN graph)
- account for multiple blinking by testing that points are not (statistically) generated by the same distribution
- clustering is approximated (NP hard)

#### Data
Synthetic data:
-We generated 130 3D datasets analogously but using within-cluster molecular densities of 1×10−4 nm−3 631 and 2×10−4 nm−3. In 3D, we used nanoclusters of radii 30 nm and 50 nm, and we used densities of random, 632 unclustered molecules equal to 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the within-cluster molecular density. At 20%, clusters 633 were barely visible in 2D projections of the simulated 3D data onto the xy-plane

#### Evaluation
NMI, F score

#### Conclusion
A whole pipeline ROI based approach, with autotuning parameters.
