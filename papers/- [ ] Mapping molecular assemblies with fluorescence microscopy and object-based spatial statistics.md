## Content
#### Research Question
Our method considers cellular geometry and densities of molecules to provide statistical maps of isolated and associated (coupled) molecules.

#### Contribution
Spots in image based interaction (coupling) analysis with statistical significance addition.

#### Method
##### Prelude
- Interaction scales : phys 1-10, complexes 10-100, copresence in domains 100-500
Input: SR image with spot detection
- Boundary correction
- Fluorescent spots are automatically detected and represented with a Marked Point Process: the point is the spotâ€™s localisation (centre of mass or intensity) and the mark embraces morphological properties as the size and the colour of the spot.
- Uses frequency and deviation from random expectation with ring based Ripleys to determine coupling probablity

#### Related Work


#### Data
Neurons, synthetic in several microscopes

#### Evaluation


#### Conclusion
Ripley ring based coupling distance/probability measure for image and localization based, given clustering
