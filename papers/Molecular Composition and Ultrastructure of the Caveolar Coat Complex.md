## Content
#### Research Question
Composition of Caveolae in membrane Coat

#### Contribution
* Caveolae = Cavins, Caveolins, EDH2, pacsin2
* cavins/Caveolins combine in 80S homogenuous complex
* CAV1/PTRF is independent from
* Cav2/Cav3 from distinct complexes with PTRF
* EDH at neck
* Coat is repeating complex of unitary Caveolar Coat Complex
* Caveolae
    * Flask shaped with diameter 50-80nm
* Caveolin
    * CAV1
        * 70S complex (Cav1 alone)
    * CAV2 not required for Caveolae
    * CAV3 required for Caveolae in striated (muscle)
* Cavins
    * Cavin1 : PTRF
        * Required for Caveolae formation in vivo (mammalian cells)
* 80SCCC is no present around neck, (EDH2), everywhere else
    * Cav1/PTRF
    * Cavin1(PTRF) 1 - Caveolin(1-2) (CAV1-2) 4
        * C1 - C2, C1 - C3, not C2-C3
        * in absence of Caveolin1
    * Cavin1 + Cavin{2|3} --> distinct subcomplexes
    * Caveolin1
        * 350-400 kDa Caveolin1 is major component
        * cavin 1 : 55, 85, 180kDA (trimer), trimer is key part of complex
        * cavin 1 trimer binds with cavin{2 ^ 3}, and caveolin1
    * stoichiometry of a core interaction between cavin 1 and caveolin 1 is independent of the presence of cavins 2 or 3.
    * These data argue that caveolar coat complexes are distributed all around the membrane bulb of caveolae.
    * Spacing of 8-14nm between densities (below resolution)
    * Linear striations
    * Stability of coat complex can depend on Cavin2 / Cavin3 balance
    * Cavin2 is associated with smaller cavin complexes
* cell lysis : breaking open of cells to analyze contents

* This is consistent with previous studies showing that cavins form high molecular weight complexes in the absence of caveolin 1, and that cavins 1 and 2 bind to each other directly in vitro [21,22,34]. In order to ascertain whether cavins 2 and 3 can interact without cavin 1, we compared co-precipiation ofcavin-2-GFP and cavin-3- mCherry in control and cavin 1 knockout MEFs (Figure S5B). In control MEFs co-precipitation was detected, but this was lost when cavin 1 was absent, arguing that cavin 2 and cavin 3 do not interact directly, and so do indeed form separate subcomplexes with cavin 1.
