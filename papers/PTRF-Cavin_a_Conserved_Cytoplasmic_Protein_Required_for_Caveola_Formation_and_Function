## Content
#### Research Question
* Cav1 - PTRF interaction

#### Contribution
* Cav1 - PTRF interaction

#### Method
* Endogenous PTRF colocalized with Cav1 at the plasma membrane but not at the Golgi complex in WT
* Caveolae, even when detached from membrane, stay in configuration
* PTRF-Cavin may be one component that becomes limiting under these conditions, since downregulation of PTRF-Cavin causes a loss of caveolae but caveolin remains at the plasma membrane and associated with DRMs. T
* cholesterol required for PTRF-Cavin/caveolin interaction
