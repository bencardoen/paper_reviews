## Content
#### Research Question
Architecture of Caveolae

#### Contribution
Outlines knowledge so far on Caveolae

#### Method
##### 80S Caveolar Coat Complex
* 80S CCC
* 2 part structure
* Polyhedral structure of polygons of caveolin 1
* cavins aligned on edges
* The N-terminal HR1 domain forms a trimeric coiled-coil, 2.5 nm wide and 15 nm long (Kovtun et al., 2014).
* 400 Kilo Dalton (molecular mass)
* EM: spherical particle 65.9 ± 9.5 nm diameter
* Striated configuration of 4nm diameter, spacing 6.5 +- 1.2
* Six planar surfaces
* Connected at 120 degree (119.7 +- 9.4)
* edge length 24.5 +- 3.6 nm
* three way junction
* hexagonal configuration
* 3D volume rendering confirmed this notion and revealed direct contacts between the peripheral and inner layers (Fig. 3F).
* We noticed that the spacing between the filamentous densities was remarkably regular (6.9 ± 1.5 nm; mean ± s.d.; n=17).
* Striations are the alignments of PTRF/Cav1 along the edges
