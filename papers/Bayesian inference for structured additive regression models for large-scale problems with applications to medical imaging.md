abstract = {In applied statistics regression models with high-dimensional coefficients can occur which cannot be estimated using ordinary computers. Amongst others, this applies to the analysis of digital images taking spatio-temporal dependencies into account as they commonly occur within bio-medical research. In this thesis a procedure is formulated which allows to fit regression models with high-dimensional coefficients and non-normal response values requiring only moderate computational equipment. To this end, limitations of different inference strategies for structured additive regression models are demonstrated when applied to high-dimensional problems and possible solutions are discussed. Based thereon an algorithm is formulated whose strengths and weaknesses are subsequently analyzed using simulation studies. Furthermore, the procedure is applied to three different fields of bio-medical imaging from which can be concluded that the algorithm is a promising candidate for answering high-dimensional problems.},
