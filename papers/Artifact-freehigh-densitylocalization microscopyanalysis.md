abstract = {High-density analysis methods for localization microscopy increase acquisition speed but produce artifacts. We demonstrate that these artifacts can be eliminated by the combination of Haar wavelet kernel (HAWK) analysis with standard single-frame fitting. We tested the performance of this method on synthetic, fixed-cell, and live-cell data, and found that HAWK preprocessing yielded reconstructions that reflected the structure of the sample, thus enabling high-speed, artifact-free super-resolution imaging of live cells.},

## Content
#### Research Question
High density reconstruction in SMLM
#### Contribution
a preprocessing method for localization microscopy data that generates a dataset several times the length of the original, with a much lower density of emitters. In effect, this new dataset is the original dataset with several different levels of temporal band-pass filtering applied. This allows fluoro- phores to be separated on the basis of their blinking behavior before localization analysis is carried out, and has the advantage that it can be paired with any other localization analysis method that does not model the fluorophore blinking properties.
