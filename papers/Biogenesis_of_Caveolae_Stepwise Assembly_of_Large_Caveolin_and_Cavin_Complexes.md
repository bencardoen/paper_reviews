## Content
#### Research Question
Describe interaction/complex formation caveolin / cavin

#### Contribution
* Cav1 assembles in 8S complex at ER exit sites
* Packages to Golgi, transformed
* Binds with cholesterol, forms 70S complex
* Vesicular carriers to membrane
* PTRF/Cavin1
* CAV2 associates with CAV1 in a stoichiometry of 1:2 to 1:4, is transported to the cell surface, and localizes to caveolae
* Cholesterol needed for formation of caveolae (else flat surface)
* Formation in ER --> Golgi --> membrane, conformation determines if antibody can detect it
* 70S has 8S as building blocks
* 8S estimated to have 7-14 Cav1
* Cav1 in caveolae : 144 +- 39
* Transfection and expression of CAV1 had no effect on knockdown levels of cavin-1
* 70S complexes are necessary and sufficient for formation of caveolae
* cavins form in 60S complex, with 60-80 cavins, cavin-1 will do so even without caveolin-1
* Individual caveolae may contain 144± 39 CAV1s (33). If the 8S complexes contain 7 caveolins as has been suggested (15), this would mean that each 70S complex may contain 15–25 of them
* This suggested that they are present as large assemblies in mature caveolae. The size is so large that one can estimate 60–80 cavins in each complex.
