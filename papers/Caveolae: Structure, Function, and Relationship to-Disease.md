## Content
#### Research Question
Caveolae reveiw

#### Contribution
Covers state of art in Caveolae

#### Method
* higher order structures of caveolae: rosettes, multiple caveolae connected through single neck
* 4-8 caveolae with single neck
* highly dense configurations
* Cav1
    * N, C terminus in cytoplasm
    * Conserved Scaffolding Domain (82-102)
    * N 1-81
    * Intramembrane 103-133
    * C 134-178
    * N is phosphorylated
* EDH alters neck morphology
* EDH knockdown leads to fewer multicaveolar assemblies
* 140-150 CAV1 / caveolae
* 50 cavins / caveolae
* Complexes are key for resistance to stretching
* However, at the level ofindividual cave-olae, it is not yet clear whether there is total caveola disassembly or an all-or-nothing response or whether some cavins can be released without total caveola flattening. Caveolae reassemble, and caveolins/cavins reassociate rapidly, after removal of a swelling stimulus (Sinha et al. 2011)
* Flattening of caveolae does not induce cavin dissociation
* breast cancer has lower cavin1/2
* CAV1 expression leads to inhibited tumor growth
* PTRF signalling hypothesis
* CAV1 is phosphorylated on Tyr14 in response to stimuli : mech stress, growth factors, oxidative stress, bacterial invasion, ..
* pCav is trigger for endocytosis (cav encapsulating and going inside cell)
* Cav1/cavin1 protects against damage (knocked down leads to necrosis of muscle cells)
* Cav1 knockdown leads to cholesterol accumulation in mitochondria, leading to disfunctional mt
* Cav1 prevents insulin resistance
