abstract = {Resolution is one of the most important properties of an imaging system, yet it remains difficult to define and apply. Rayleigh's and Abbe's resolution criteria were developed for observations with the human eye and had a major influence on the development of optical instruments. However, no systematic approach is available for the evaluation of the often complex image processing algorithms that have become central to the analysis of the imaging data that today is acquired by highly sensitive cameras. Here, we introduce a novel resolution criterion for image analysis algorithms, which we term algorithmic resolution, based on spatial statistics methods that is independent of both the imaging system that produced the data and the specifics of the objects being analyzed.},
