#### Research Question
Compressive sensing

#### Contribution
* Can obtain super-resolved signals from just a few sensors
* Sensing is nonadaptive: no effort to understand the signal
* Simple acquisition process followed by numerical optimization

#### Method
* Idea of compression (e.g. wavelets) is to read all, keep highest magnitudes
* Measure everything (all the pixels, all the coefficients)
  Keep d largest coefficients: distortion is kx âˆ’ xdk
* Compressed sensing viewpoint
  * Take m random measurements: yk = hx, aki
  * Reconstruct by linear programming
* Sensing/recovery is robust to noise (and other imperfections)
* Shannon / Nyquist
  * Sampling rate > 2 highest frequency
  * Almost unfeasible for high frequencies
* Information bandwidth < total bandwidth
* Compressive sampling: acquisition in an
  incoherent domain
