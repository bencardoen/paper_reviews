## Content
#### Research Question
80S CCC hypothesis

#### Contribution
Defines the polyhedral model for caveolae

#### Method
* Svedberg (higher is sediments faster, molecular weight)
* Cavin1 (PTRF) + Caveolin 1 assemble into 80S complex
* 80S CCC is only configuration
* Stochiometry : cavin1 (PTRF) 1 : 4 caveolin (X)
* cavins compete for binding sites
* cavin2/3 compete, not with cavin1
* Distribution of cavin1/2/3 caveolin1 is uniform around caveolae
* EDH2 not present in coat
* Dense colocalizations separated 10-15nm apart
