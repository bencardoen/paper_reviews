abstract = {Presynaptic Cav2.2 (N-type) calcium channels are subject to modulation by interaction with syntaxin 1 and by a syntaxin 1-sensitive G$\alpha$o G-protein pathway. We used biochemical analysis of neuronal tissue lysates and a new quantitative test of colocalization by intensity correlation analysis at the giant calyx-type presynaptic terminal of the chick ciliary ganglion to explore the association of Cav2.2 with syntaxin 1 and G$\alpha$o. Cav2.2 could be localized by immunocytochemistry (antibody Ab571) in puncta on the release site aspect of the presynaptic terminal and close to synaptic vesicle clouds. Syntaxin 1 coimmunoprecipitated with Cav2.2 from chick brain and chick ciliary ganglia and was widely distributed on the presynaptic terminal membrane. A fraction of the total syntaxin 1 colocalized with the Cav2.2 puncta, whereas the bulk colocalized with MUNC18-1. G$\alpha$o, whether in its trimeric or monomeric state, did not coimmunoprecipitate with Ca v2.2, MUNC18-1, or syntaxin 1. However, the G-protein exhibited a punctate staining on the calyx membrane with an intensity that varied in synchrony with that for both Ca channels and syntaxin 1 but only weakly with MUNC18-1. Thus, syntaxin 1 appears to be a component of two separate complexes at the presynaptic terminal, a minor one at the transmitter release site with Cav2.2 and G$\alpha$o, as well as in large clusters remote from the release site with MUNC18-1. These syntaxin 1 protein complexes may play distinct roles in presynaptic biology.},

## Content
#### Research Question
Intensity correlation in fluorescence microscopy as an estimator of colocalization

#### Contribution

#### Method
Intensity correlation analysis (ICA)
- Can we go beyond matching intensity
- higher order statistics, variation of intensity should match
- ICQ (intensity correlation quotient)
  - non parametric sign test (data is not normally distributed)
  - of limited application to SMLM due to anitbody complexity, pixel based

#### Evaluation

#### Conclusion
A correlation of variation metric to uncover colocalization.
